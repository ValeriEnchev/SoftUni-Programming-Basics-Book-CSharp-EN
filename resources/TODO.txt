Amazon Review

Title:
More than a book: video tutorials + online coding exercise system
 
 
The book "Programming Basics with C#" is an excellent hand-on tutorial to learn coding. The book is designed to mix video lessons with tutorial-style reading, live code examples (with "Run Code" button) and live coding exercises with automated evaluation and grading system (you write the solution in C# and submit it and after 2-3 seconds you have automated grading: correct / wrong / partially correct).

The most impressive is that all the above (book + video lessons + online grading system) is available for free to anyone.

I really like the "learn by doing" approach and book structure. For each chapter the structure goes like this:
1) Some new content with examples and video lesson
2) Live code examples, that you can try directly in the Web browser
3) Exercises to learn the new skills, with increasing complexity: from extremely easy to moderate and hard problems

In conclusion, I would say that this is a free modern, integrated learning platform to develop coding skills, more than just a book on programming for beginners. I highly recommend and I truly believe that it is one of the best in the world.
